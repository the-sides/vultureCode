What is the big problem?
	* Researching programming questions take too long
	* Requires loading numeruous pages, most of which do not contain answer

What is the subproblem? 
	* Google's filter options are not being utilized
	* Unnecessary data is being loaded

High-level approach by tool?
	Provided a simple/intiutive UI for Google'ing questions and combine 
	several results from varying sources into one page with only relvant information

What approaches have others tried?
	The current solution is using one of the several sites already available 
	for asking a specific question. However some sites like StackOverflow have 
	been around for more than a decade. Any question someone might has probably 
	been asked before on any of the pre-existing sites. 

Why aren't they enough?
	Because these sites do not combine their results with other sites. 
	Google is used to look amongst several sites, however Google is 
	built for a regular users and generic searches. A better searching platform
	should exist for the sole purpose of aiding developers. 

Background Info:

Tool:
	
Propsed Evaluation:
	20 or so CS participants. 
	Provide a sample question they must research.
	Half of participants will look for the answer using traditional search engine.
	Other will use Vulture
	Compare speeds and ability to integrate knowledge.
